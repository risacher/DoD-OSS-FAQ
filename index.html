Frequently Asked Questions regarding Open Source Software (OSS) and the Department of Defense (DoD)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page is an educational resource for government employees and
government contractors to understand the policies and legal issues
relating to the use of open source software (OSS) in the Department of
Defense (DoD). The information on this page does not constitute legal
advice and any legal questions relating to specific situations should be
referred to legal counsel. References to specific products or
organizations are for information only, and do not constitute an
endorsement of the product/company.



Defining Open Source Software (OSS)
-----------------------------------

### Q: What is open source software (OSS)?

The 16 October 2009 memorandum from the DoD CIO, ["Clarifying Guidance
Regarding Open Source Software
(OSS)"](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf),
defines OSS
as "software for which the human-readable source code is available for
use, study, re-use, modification, enhancement, and re-distribution by
the users of that software".

Careful legal review is required to determine if a given license is
really an open source software license. The following organizations
examine licenses; licenses should pass at least the first two industry
review processes, and preferably all of them, else they have a greatly
heightened risk of not being an open source software license:

-   Open source software licenses are reviewed and approved as
    conforming to the [Open Source
    Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) by the
    [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](http://www.opensource.org/). The OSI
    publishes [a list of licenses which have successfully gone through
    the approval process and comply with the Open Source
    Definition](http://opensource.org/licenses).
-   In practice, an open source software license must also meet the [GNU
    Free Software
    Definition](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html); the GNU
    project [publishes a list of licenses that meet the Free Software
    Definition](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses).
-   Fedora reviews licenses and publishes a list of ["good" licenses
    that Fedora has determined are open source software
    licenses](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing).
-   [Debian-legal](http://people.debian.org/%7Ebap/dfsg-faq.html) also
    examines licenses (for Debian) to determine if they meet the [Debian
    social contract](http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines);
    the [Debian license
    information](http://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/) lists licenses
    that are known to pass (or not pass) these criteria.

In practice, nearly all open source software is released under one of a
very few licenses that are known to meet this definition. These licenses
include the [MIT
license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), [revised
BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) (and
its 2-clause variant), the [Apache 2.0
license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php), the [GNU
Lesser General Public License
(LGPL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php) versions
2.1 or 3, and the [GNU General Public License
(GPL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php) versions 2 or
3. Using a standard license simplifies collaboration and eliminates many
legal analysis costs.

### Q: What are synonyms for open source software?

"Open source software" is also called "Free software", "libre software",
"Free/open source software (FOSS or F/OSS)", and "Free/Libre/Open Source
Software (FLOSS)". The term "Free software" predates the term "open
source software", but the term "Free software" has sometimes been
misinterpreted as meaning "no cost", which is *not* the intended meaning
in this context. ("Free" in "Free software" refers to freedom, not
price.) The term "open source software" is sometimes hyphenated as
"open-source software".

The DoD has chosen to use the term "open source software" (OSS) in its
official policy documents.

### Q: What are antonyms for open source software?

Commercially-available software that is *not* open source software is
typically called *proprietary* or *closed source* software.

### Q: Is this related to "open source intelligence"?

No.  In the [Intelligence Community](http://intelligence.gov/)
(IC), the term "open source" typically refers to overt, publicly
available sources (as opposed to covert or classified sources).  Thus,
[Open Source Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (OSINT)
is form of intelligence collection management that involves finding,
selecting, and acquiring information from publicly available sources and
analyzing it to produce actionable intelligence.

As noted above, in software, "Open Source" refers to "software for which
the human-readable source code is available for use, study, re-use,
modification, enhancement, and re-distribution by the users of that
software".

### Q: Is there a name for software whose source code is publicly available, but does not meet the definition of open source software?

At this time there is no widely-accepted term for software whose
source code is available for review but does not meet the definition
of open source software (due to restrictions on use, modification, or
redistribution). Terms that people have used include "source available
software", "open-box software", "visible-source software", and
"disclosed-source software". (Such terms might *include* open source
software, but could also include other software). Obviously, software
that does not meet the definition of open source software is not open
source software.

OSS and DoD Policy
------------------

### Q: What policies address the use of open source software (OSS) in the Department of Defense?

The following policies apply:

1.  The DoD CIO issued a memorandum titled ["Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open
    Source Software
    (OSS)"](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf) on 16
    October 2009, which superseded a memo May 2003 memo from John
    Stenbit.
2.  The Department of Navy CIO issued a memorandum with guidance on open
    source software on 5 Jun 2007. This memorandum only applies to Navy
    and Marine Corps commands, but may be a useful reference for others.
    This memo is available at
    [http://www.doncio.navy.mil/contentview.aspx?id=312](http://www.doncio.navy.mil/contentview.aspx?id=312). The Department
    of the Navy has also issued [SECNAVINST
    5230.15](http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?id=998), which
    is focused on ensuring that Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Software
    is supported throughout its fielded lifecycle. This SECNAVINST also
    applies to OSS.
3.  The Open Technology Development Roadmap was released by the office
    of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and
    Concepts, on 7 Jun 2006. It is available at
    [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a450769.pdf](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a450769.pdf) .
4.  The Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum providing
    guidance on software acquisition which specifically addressed open
    source software on 1 Jul 2004. It may be found at
    [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-16.html](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-16.html).
5.  US Army Regulation 25-2, paragraph 4-6.h, provides guidance on
    software security controls that specifically addresses open source
    software. This regulation only applies to the US Army, but may be a
    useful reference for others. The regulation is available at
    [http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r25_2.pdf](http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r25_2.pdf) .

In nearly all cases, OSS is commercial software, so the policies
regarding commercial software continue to apply to OSS.



### Q: Isn't using open source software (OSS) forbidden by DoD Information Assurance (IA) Policy?

No. DoD policy requires commercial software (including OSS) to come with
*either* a warranty *or* source code, so that the software can be
maintained when necessary by the supplier or the government. Since OSS
provides source code, there is no problem.

This misconception comes from a misinterpretation of DoD Instruction
8500.2, “Information Assurance (IA) Implementation”, Enclosure 4,
control DCPD-1. The control in question reads:

> DCPD-1 Public Domain Software Controls 
>
>  Binary or machine executable public domain software products and
> other software products with limited or no warranty such as those
> commonly known as freeware or shareware are not used in DoD
> information systems unless they are necessary for mission
> accomplishment and there are no alternative IT solutions available.
> Such products are assessed for information assurance impacts, and
> approved for use by the DAA. The assessment addresses the fact that
> such software products are difficult or impossible to review, repair,
> or extend, given that the Government does not have access to the
> original source code and there is no owner who could make such repairs
> on behalf of the Government.

This control is intended to limit the use of certain kinds of “binary or
machine executable” software when “the Government does not have access
to the original source code”. As clarified in the 2009 DoD CIO
Memorandum attachment 2(2)(c), this control does not prohibit the use of
open source software, since with open source software the government
*does* have access to the original source code.

Note that the federal government's IA controls, as documented in [NIST
SP 800-53 revision 3](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)
includes an equivalent control enhancement, SA-6(1) (under "Software
Usage Restrictions"). Control enhancement SA-6(1) states that an
organization must prohibit "the use of binary or machine executable code
from sources with limited or no warranty without accompanying source
code". The control enhancement's guidance states that a special
assessment is needed because software where there is no source code and
no warranty "are difficult or impossible to review, repair, or extend,
given that the organization does not have access to the original source
code and there is no owner who could make such repairs on behalf of the
organization." The [draft NIST SP 800-53 revision 4 of February
2012](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-53-rev4/sp800-53-rev4-ipd.pdf)
moves this text from SA-6(1) to control enhancement SI-7(15). Since the
government has access to the source code of OSS, by definition,
organizations using this control enhancement do not need to make any
special assessment of OSS.

The [Application Security and Development Security Technical
Implementation Guide
(STIG)](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/app_security/app_sec/app_sec.html)
Version 3, Release 4 (October 28, 2011) corrects this misunderstanding
(older versions *did* promulgate this misunderstanding). This version
includes these two italicized policy bullets, which specifically note
that special DAA acceptance of risk is not required when source code is
available to review, repair, and extend the software (as is true for
open source software):

-   (APP2090.1: CAT II) The Program Manager will obtain DAA acceptance
    of risk for all public domain, shareware, freeware, and other
    software products/libraries with both (1) no source code to review,
    repair, and extend, and (2) limited or no warranty, but are required
    for mission accomplishment.
-   (APP2090.2: CAT II) The Designer will document for DAA approval all
    , public domain, shareware, freeware, and other software
    products/libraries with both (1) no source code to review, repair,
    and extend, and (2) limited or no warranty, but are required for
    mission accomplishment.

General information about OSS
-----------------------------

### Q: Is open source software commercial software? Is it COTS?

Nearly all OSS is commercial software, and if it used unchanged (or with
only minor changes), it is almost always COTS.

Open source software that has at least one non-governmental use, and is
licensed to the public, is commercial software. If it is already
available to the public and is used unchanged, it is usually COTS.

U.S. law governing federal procurement
[U.S. Code Title 41, Chapter 7, Section 403](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/41/usc_sec_41_00000403----000-.html) defines "commercial item"
as including "Any item, other than real property, that is of a type
customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities
for purposes other than governmental purposes (i.e., it has some
non-government use), and (i) Has been sold, leased, or **licensed** to
the general public; or (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license
to the general public ...". Thus, as long as the software has at least
one non-governmental use, software licensed (or offered for license) to
the public is a commercial item for procurement purposes.

Similarly,
[U.S. Code Title 41, Chapter 7, Section 431](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode41/usc_sec_41_00000431----000-.html) defines the term
"Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item"; software is COTS if
it is (a) a "commercial item", (b) sold in substantial quantities in the
commercial marketplace, and (c) is offered to the Government, without
modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial
marketplace. Thus, OSS available to the public and used unchanged is
normally COTS.

These definitions in U.S. law govern U.S. acquisition regulations,
namely the [Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR)](http://www.acquisition.gov/far/) and the [Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement
(DFARS)](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarspgi/current/index.html).
[DFARS 252.227-7014 Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and
Noncommercial Computer Software
Documentation](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252227.htm)
defines "Commercial computer software" as "software developed or
regularly used for non-governmental purposes which: (i) Has been sold,
leased, or licensed to the public; (ii) Has been offered for sale,
lease, or license to the public; (iii) Has not been offered, sold,
leased, or licensed to the public but will be available for commercial
sale, lease, or license in time to satisfy the delivery requirements of
this contract; or (iv) Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph
(a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause and would require only minor
modification to meet the requirements of this contract."

There are many other reasons to believe nearly all OSS is commercial
software:

-   OSS is increasingly commercially developed and supported.
-   OSS projects typically seek financial gain in the form of
    improvements.
    [U.S. Code Title 17, section 101](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000101----000-.html) (part of copyright law) explicitly
    defines the term “financial gain” as including “receipt, or
    expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt
    of other copyrighted works.”
-   OSS licenses and projects clearly approve of commercial support

This is confirmed by "Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open Source Software
(OSS)" (2009) and the Department of the Navy "Open Source Software
Guidance" (signed June 5, 2007). For more discussion on this topic, see
the article [Open Source Software Is
Commercial](http://journal.thedacs.com/issue/56/151).

By definition, software that does not meet the U.S. government's
definition of "commercial software" is not considered commercial
software by the U.S. government's acquisition processes. For example,
software that is released to the public as OSS is not considered
commercial if it is a type of software is *only* used for governmental
purposes. In contracts where this issue is important, you should examine
the contract to find the specific definition of "commercial software"
that is being used. But in practice, publicly-released OSS nearly always
meets the various government definitions for "commercial software" --
and thus is nearly always considered commercial software.

### Q: Why is it important to understand that open source software is commercial software?

It is important to understand that open source software is commercial
software, because there are many laws, regulations, policies, and so on
regarding commercial software. Failing to understand that open source
software is commercial software would result in failing to follow the
laws, regulations, policies, and so on regarding commercial software.

In particular, U.S. law
([10 USC 2377](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00002377----000-.html)) requires a preference for commercial items for procurement
of supplies or services. 10 USC 2377 requires that the head of an agency
shall ensure that procurement officials in that agency, to the maximum
extent practicable:

1.  "acquire commercial items or nondevelopmental items other than
    commercial items to meet the needs of the agency;
2.  require prime contractors and subcontractors at all levels under the
    agency contracts to incorporate commercial items or nondevelopmental
    items other than commercial items as components of items supplied to
    the agency;
3.  modify requirements in appropriate cases to ensure that the
    requirements can be met by commercial items or, to the extent that
    commercial items suitable to meet the agency’s needs are not
    available, nondevelopmental items other than commercial items;
4.  state specifications in terms that enable and encourage bidders and
    offerors to supply commercial items or, to the extent that
    commercial items suitable to meet the agency’s needs are not
    available, nondevelopmental items other than commercial items in
    response to the agency solicitations;
5.  revise the agency’s procurement policies, practices, and procedures
    not required by law to reduce any impediments in those policies,
    practices, and procedures to the acquisition of commercial items;
    and
6.  require training of appropriate personnel in the acquisition of
    commercial items."

Similarly, it requires preliminary market research to determine "whether
there are commercial items or, to the extent that commercial items
suitable to meet the agency’s needs are not available, nondevelopmental
items other than commercial items available" that "(A) meet the agency’s
requirements; (B) could be modified to meet the agency’s requirements;
or (C) could meet the agency’s requirements if those requirements were
modified to a reasonable extent." This market research should occur
"before developing new specifications for a procurement by that agency;
and before soliciting bids or proposals for a contract in excess of the
simplified acquisition threshold."

An agency that failed to consider open source software, and instead only
considered proprietary software, would fail to comply with these laws,
because it would unjustifiably exclude a significant part of the
commercial market. This is particularly the case where future
modifications by the U.S. government may be necessary, since OSS by
definition permits modification.

### Q: Are "non-commercial software", "freeware", or "shareware" the same thing as open source software?

No.

Do not mistakenly use the term "non-commercial software" as a synonym
for "open source software". As noted above, in nearly all cases, open
source software is considered "commercial software" by U.S. law, the
FAR, and the DFARS.  [DFARS
252.227-7014](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252227.htm#252.227-7014)
specifically defines "commercial computer software" in a way that
includes nearly all OSS, and defines "noncommercial computer software”
as software that does *not* qualify as "commercial computer
software". In addition, important open source software is typically
supported by one or more commercial firms.

Also, do not use the terms "freeware" or "shareware" as a synonym for
"open source software". DoD Instruction 8500.2, “Information Assurance
(IA) Implementation”, Enclosure 4, control DCPD-1, states that these
terms apply to software where "the Government does not have access to
the original source code".  The government ''does ''have access to the
original source code of open source software, so by definition OSS is
not "freeware" or "shareware".

### Q: How is OSS typically developed?

OSS is typically developed through a collaborative process.

Most OSS projects have a “trusted repository”, that is, some (web)
location where people can get the “official” version of the program, as
well as related information (documentation, bug report system, mailing
lists, etc.). Users can get their software directly from the trusted
repository, or get it through distributors who acquire it (and provide
additional value such as integration with other components, testing,
special configuration, support, and so on).

Only some developers are allowed to modify the trusted repository
directly: the trusted developers. At project start, the project creators
(who create the initial trusted repository) are the trusted developers,
and they determine who else may become a trusted developer of this
initial trusted repository. All other developers can make changes to
their local copies, and even post their versions to the Internet (a
process made especially easy by distributed software configuration
management tools), but they must submit their changes to a trusted
developer to get their changes into the trusted repository.

Users can send bug reports to the distributor or trusted repository,
just as they could for a proprietary program. But what is radically
different is that a user can actually make a change to the program
itself (either directly, or by hiring someone to do it). Since users
will want to use the improvements made by others, they have a strong
financial incentive to submit their improvements to the trusted
repository. That way, their improvements will be merged with the
improvements of others, enabling them to use all improvements instead of
only their own.

This can create an avalanche-like “virtuous cycle”. As the program
becomes more capable, more users are attracted to using it. A very small
percentage of such users determine that they can make a change valuable
to them, and contribute it back (to avoid maintenance costs). As more
improvements are made, more people can use the product, creating more
potential users as developers - like a snowball that gains mass as it
rolls downhill.

This enables cost-sharing between users, as with proprietary development
models.  However, this cost-sharing is done in a rather different way
than in proprietary development.  In particular, note that the costs
borne by a particular organization are typically only those for whatever
improvements or services are used (e.g., installation, configuration,
help desk, etc.). In contrast, typical proprietary software costs are
per-seat, not per-improvement or service. However, it must be noted that
the OSS model is much more reflective of the actual costs borne by
development organizations. It costs essentially nothing to send a file
or burn a CD-ROM of software; once it exists, all software costs are due
to maintenance and support of software. In short, OSS more accurately
reflects the economics of software development; some speculate that this
is one reason why OSS has become so common so quickly.

![OSS Development Model](images/oss-development-model.png "image")

### Q: Isn't OSS developed primarily by inexperienced students?

No, OSS is developed by a wide variety of software developers, and the
average developer is quite experienced. A [Boston Consulting
Group](http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/lakhaniwolf.pdf) study found
that the average age of OSS developers was 30 years old, the majority
had training in information technology and/or computer science, and on
average had 11.8 years of computer programming experience.

### Q: Is open source software the same as "open systems/open standards"?

No, although they work well together, and both are strategies for
reducing ["vendor lock-in"](http://www.linfo.org/vendor_lockin.html).
Vendor lock-in, aka lock-in, is the situation in which customers are
dependent on a single supplier for some product (i.e., a good or
service), or products, and cannot move to another vendor without
substantial costs and/or inconvenience. Lock-in tends to raise costs
substantially, reduces long-term value (including functionality,
innovation, and reliability), and can become a serious security problem
(since the supplier has little incentive to provide a secure product and
to quickly fix problems found later).
 An "Open System" is a "system that employs modular design, uses widely
supported and consensus based standards for its key interfaces, and has
been subjected to successful V&V tests to ensure the openness of its key
interfaces" (per the DoD OSJTF). Thus, open systems require standards
that are widely-supported and consensus-based; standards that meet these
(and possibly some additional conditions) may be termed "open
standards". Open systems and open standards counter dependency on a
single supplier, though only if there is a competing marketplace of
replaceable components. Indeed, according to
[Walli](http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix05/tech/slides/walli.pdf),
"Standards exist to encourage & enable multiple implementations". Many
governments, not just the U.S., view open systems as critically
necessary. DoD Directive 5000.1 states that open systems “shall be
employed, where feasible”, and the European Commission identifies open
standards as a major policy thrust.

There are many definitions for the term "open standard". Fundamentally,
a standard is a specification, so an "open standard" is a specification
that is "open". Public definitions include those of the [European
Interoperability Framework
(EIF)](http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/3761), the [Digistan
definition of open
standard](http://www.digistan.org/open-standard:definition) (based on
the EIF), and [Bruce Perens’ “Open Standards: Principles and
Practice”](http://perens.com/OpenStandards/Definition.html).

In the DoD, the [DISRonline](https://disronline.disa.mil/) is a useful
resource for identifying recommended standards (which tend to be open
standards). DISRonline is a collection of web-based applications
supporting the continuing evolution of the Department of Defense (DoD)
Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR). [DAU has some
information about
DISRonline](https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=25809). The
[Open Systems Joint Task Force (OSJTF) web
page](http://www.acq.osd.mil/osjtf/) also provides some useful
background.

Increasingly, many DoD capabilities are accessible via web browsers
using open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, and CSS; in such cases,
it is relatively easy to use or switch to open source software
implementations (since the platforms used to implement the client or
server become less relevant).  As noted by the OSJTF definition for open
systems, be sure to test such systems with more than one web browser
(e.g., Internet Explorer and Firefox), to reduce the risk of vendor
lock-in.

### Q: How does open source software work with open systems/open standards?

Open standards can aid open source software projects:

-   Open standards make it easier for users to (later) adopt an open
    source software program, because users of open standards aren’t
    locked into a particular implementation. Instead, users who are
    careful to use open standards can easily switch to a different
    implementation, including an OSS implementation.
-   Open standards also make it easier for OSS developers to create
    their projects, because the standard itself helps developers know
    what to do. Creating any interface is an effort, and having a
    pre-defined standard helps reduce that effort greatly.

Note that open standards aid proprietary software in exactly the same
way.

OSS aids open standards, too:

-   OSS implementations can help create and keep open standards open. An
    OSS implementation can be read and modified by anyone; such
    implementations can quickly become a working reference model (a
    "sample implementation" or an "executable specification") that
    demonstrates what the specification means (clarifying the
    specification) and demonstrating how to actually implement it.
    Perhaps more importantly, by forcing there to be an implementation
    that others can examine in detail, resulting in better
    specifications that are more likely to be used.
-   OSS implementations can help rapidly increase adoption/use of the
    open standard. OSS programs can typically be simply downloaded and
    tried out, making it much easier for people to try it out and
    encouraging widespread use. This also pressures proprietary
    implementations to limit their prices, and such lower prices for
    proprietary software also encourages use of the standard.

With practically no exceptions, successful open standards have OSS
implementations.

So, while open systems/open standards are different from open source
software, they are complementary and can work well together.

### Q: How does open source software relate to the Buy America Act?

As noted by the 16 October 2009 policy memorandum from the DoD CIO, in
almost all cases OSS is a commercial item as defined by US Law (Title
41) and regulation (the FAR).

The Buy America Act does not apply to information technology that is a
commercial item, so there is usually no problem for OSS. As stated in
FAR 25.103 Exceptions item (e), "The restriction on purchasing foreign
end products does not apply to the acquisition of information technology
that is a commercial item, when using fiscal year 2004 or subsequent
fiscal year funds (Section 535(a) of Division F, Title V, Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2004, and similar sections in subsequent
appropriations acts)."

OSS Licenses
------------

### Q: What is the legal basis of OSS licenses?

Software licenses, including those for open source software, are
typically based on copyright law. Under U.S. copyright law, users must
have permission (i.e. a license) from the copyright holder(s) before
they can obtain a copy of software to run on their system(s). Authors of
a creative work, or their employer, normally receive the copyright once
the work is in a fixed form (e.g., written/typed).  Others can obtain
permission to use a copyrighted work by obtaining a license from the
copyright holder.  Typically, obtaining rights granted by the license
can only be obtained when the requestor agrees to certain conditions.
For example, users of proprietary software must typically pay for a
license to use a copy or copies. Open source software licenses grant
more rights than proprietary software licenses, but they are still
conditional licenses that require the user to obey certain terms.

Software licenses (including OSS licenses) may also involve the laws for
patent, trademark, and trade secrets, in addition to copyright. 

Export control laws are often not specifically noted in OSS licenses,
but nevertheless these laws also govern when and how software may be
released.

### Q: Are OSS licenses legally enforceable?

Yes, in general. For advice about a *specific* situation, however,
consult with legal counsel.

The [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's 2008 ruling on
Jacobsen v. Katzer](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1001.pdf)
made it clear that OSS licenses are enforceable, even if money is not
exchanged.  It noted that a copyright holder may dedicate a "certain
work to free public use and yet enforce an 'open source' copyright
license to control the future distribution and modification of that
work... Open source licensing has become a widely used method of
creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a
manner and at a pace that few could have imagined just a few decades
ago... Traditionally, copyright owners sold their copyrighted material
in exchange for money. The lack of money changing hands in open source
licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic
consideration, however. There are substantial benefits, including
economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works
under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license
royalties... The choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance
with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of
changes, rather than as a dollar-denominated fee, is entitled to no less
legal recognition. Indeed, because a calculation of damages is
inherently speculative, these types of license restrictions might well
be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive
relief." In short, it determined that the OSS license at issue in the
case (the Artistic license) was indeed an enforceable license.

["Enforcing the GNU GPL" by Eben
Moglen](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.html) is a brief
essay that argues why the GNU General Public License (GPL),
specifically, is enforceable. U.S. courts have determined that the GPL
does not violate anti-trust laws. In [Wallace vs.
FSF](http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Wallace_v_FSF/Wallace_v_FSF-41.pdf),
Judge Daniel Tinder stated that "the GPL encourages, rather than
discourages, free competition and the distribution of computer operating
systems..." and found no anti-trust issues with the GPL. Similarly, in
[Wallace v. IBM, Red Hat, and
Novell](http://www.internetcases.com/library/cases/2006-11-09_wallace_v_ibm.pdf),
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found in November 2006
that the GNU General Public License (GPL) "and open-source software have
nothing to fear from the antitrust laws". [German courts have enforced
the
GPL](http://www.wilmerhale.com/publications/whPubsDetail.aspx?publication=346).

### Q: What are the major types of open source software licenses?

OSS licenses can be grouped into three main categories: Permissive,
strongly protective, and weakly protective. Here is an explanation of
these categories, along with common licenses used in each category (see
[The Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) License
Slide](http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html)):

-   Permissive: These licenses permit the software to become proprietary
    (i.e., not OSS). This includes the [MIT
    license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and the
    [revised BSD
    license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php). The
    [Apache 2.0
    license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php) is also a
    popular license in this category; note that the Apache 2.0 license
    is compatible with GPL version 3, but not with GPL version 2.
-   Strongly Protective (aka strong copyleft): These licenses prevent
    the software from becoming proprietary, and instead enforce a "share
    and share alike" approach. In such licenses, if you give someone a
    binary of the program, you are obligated to give them the source
    code (perhaps upon request) under the same terms.  This includes the
    most popular OSS license, the [GNU General Public License
    (GPL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php). There
    are two versions of the GPL in common use today: the older version
    2, and the newer version 3.
-   Weakly Protective (aka weak copyleft): These licenses are a
    compromise between permissive and strongly protective licenses.
    These prevent the software component (often a software library) from
    becoming proprietary, yet permit it to be part of a larger
    proprietary program. The [GNU Lesser General Public License
    (LGPL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php) is the
    most popular such license, and there are two versions in common use:
    the older version 2.1 and newer version 3. An alternative approach
    is to use the GPL plus a [GPL linking exception term (such as the
    "Classpath
    exception")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_linking_exception).

### Q: How can you determine if different open source software licenses are compatible?

In general, legal analysis is required to determine if multiple
programs, covered by different OSS licenses, can be legally combined
into a single larger work. This legal analysis must determine if it is
possible to meet the conditions of all relevant licenses simultaneously.
If it is possible to meet the conditions of all relevant licenses
simultaneously, then those licenses are *compatible*.

Thankfully, such analyses has already been performed on the common OSS
licenses, which tend to be mutually compatible. Many analyses focus on
versions of the GNU General Public License (GPL), since this is the most
common OSS license, but analyses for other licenses are also available.
Resources for further information include:

-   [GPL FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility)
    (Focuses on compatibility between versions of the GPL and LGPL)
-   [The Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) License
    Slide](http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html)
-   [Various Licenses and Comments about
    Them](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html)
-   [Maintaining Permissive-Licensed Files in a GPL-Licensed Project:
    Guidelines for Developers (Software Freedom Law
    Center)](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html)
-   [Fedora Licensing](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing)

In brief, the MIT and 2-clause BSD license are dominated by the 3-clause
BSD license, which are all dominated by the LGPL licenses, which are all
dominated by the GPL licenses.  By "dominate", that means that when
software is merged which have those pairs of licenses, the dominating
license essentially governs the resulting combination because the
dominating license essentially includes all the key terms of the other
license.  This also means that these particular licenses are compatible.
The Apache 2.0 license is compatible with the GPL version 3 license, but
not the GPL version 2 license.  The GPL version 2 and the GPL version 3
are in principle incompatible with each other, but in practice, most
released OSS states that it is "GPL version 2 or later" or "GPL version
3 or later"; in these cases, version 3 is a common license and thus such
software is compatible.

Note that this sometimes depends on how the program is used or modified.
For example, the LGPL permits the covered software (usually a library)
to be embedded in a larger work under many different licenses (including
proprietary licenses), subject to certain conditions. However, if the
covered software/library is *itself* modified, then additional
conditions are imposed.

This need for legal analysis is one reason why creating new OSS licenses
is strongly discouraged: It can be extremely difficult, costly, and
time-consuming to analyze the interplay of many different licenses. It
is usually far better to stick to licenses that have already gone
through legal review and are widely used in the commercial world.

### Q: Can OSS licenses and approaches be used for material other than software?

Yes. The [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) is a non-profit
organization that provides free tools, including a set of licenses, to
"let authors, scientists, artists, and educators easily mark their
creative work with the freedoms they want it to carry".  A copyright
holder who releases creative works under one of the Creative Common
licenses that permit commercial use and modifications would be using an
OSS-like approach for such works. 
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) maintains an encyclopedia using
approaches similar to open source software approaches. Note that
[Creative Commons does not recommend that you use one of their licenses
for
software](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F);
they encourage using one of the existing OSS licenses which "were
designed specifically for use with software".

Computer and electronic hardware that is designed in the same fashion as
open source software (OSS) is sometimes termed [open source
hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_hardware). The term has
primarily been used to reflect the free release of information about the
hardware design, such as schematics, bill of materials and PCB layout
data, or its representation in a hardware description language (HDL),
often with the use of open source software to drive the hardware.

Software/hardware for which the implementation, proofs of its
properties, and all required tools are released under an OSS license are
termed [open proofs](http://www.openproofs.org/)(see the [open proofs
website for more information](http://www.openproofs.org/)).

Where it is unclear, make it clear what the "source" or "source code"
means.

(See [GPL FAQ, "Can I use the GPL for something other than
software?"](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLOtherThanSoftware).)



### Q: Is it more difficult to comply with OSS licenses than proprietary licenses?

No, complying with OSS licenses is much easier than proprietary licenses
if you only use the software in the same way that proprietary software
is normally used.  By definition, OSS software permits arbitrary use of
the software, and allows users to re-distribute the software to others. 
The terms that apply to usage and redistribution tend to be trivially
easy to meet (e.g., you must not remove the license or author credits
when re-distributing the software).  Thus, complex license management
processes to track every installation or use of the software, or who is
permitted to use the software, is completely unnecessary.  Support for
OSS is often sold separately for OSS; in such cases, you must comply
with the support terms for those uses to receive support, but these are
typically the same kinds of terms that apply to proprietary software
(and they tend to be simpler in practice).

It is only when the OSS is modified that additional OSS terms come into
play, depending on the OSS license.  Since it is typically not legal to
modify proprietary software at all, or it is legal only in very limited
ways, it is trivial to determine when these additional terms may apply. 
The real challenge is one of education - some developers incorrectly
believe that just because something is free to download, it can be
merged or changed without restriction.  This has never been true, and
explaining this takes little time.

### Q: Who can enforce OSS licenses?

Typically enforcement actions are based on copyright violations, and
only copyright holders can raise a copyright claim in U.S. court. In the
commercial world, the copyright holders are typically the individuals
and organizations that originally developed the software. Under the
current DoD contracting regime, the contractor usually retains the
copyright for software developed with government funding, so in such
cases the contractor (not the government) has the right to sue for
copyright violation. In some cases, the government obtains the
copyright; in those cases, the government can sue for copyright
violation.

However, the government can release software as OSS when it has
unlimited rights to that software. The government is not the copyright
holder in such cases, but the government can still enforce its rights.
Although the government cannot directly sue for copyright violation, in
such cases it can still sue for breach of license and, presumably, get
injunctive relief to stop the breach and money damages to recover
royalties obtained by breaching the license (and perhaps other damages
as well).

In addition, a third party who breaches a software license (including
for OSS) granted by the government risks losing rights they would
normally have due to the "doctrine of unclean hands". The [doctrine of
unclean hands](http://dictionary.law.com/definition.asp?selected=2182),
per law.com, is "a legal doctrine which is a defense to a complaint,
which states that a party who is asking for a judgment cannot have the
help of the court if he/she has done anything unethical in relation to
the subject of the lawsuit. Thus, if a defendant can show the plaintiff
had 'unclean hands,' the plaintiff's complaint will be dismissed or the
plaintiff will be denied judgment." So if the government releases
software as OSS, and a malicious developer performs actions in violation
of that license, then the government's courts might choose to not
enforce any of that malicious developer's intellectual rights to that
result. In effect, the malicious developer could lose many or all rights
over their license-violating result, even rights they would normally
have had! Since OSS licenses are quite generous, the only
license-violating actions a developer is likely to try is to release
software under a more stringent license... and those will have little
effect if they cannot be enforced in court.

See [GPL FAQ, "Who has the power to enforce the
GPL?"](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhoHasThePower).

### Q: Do choice of venue clauses automatically disqualify OSS licences?

No. A "choice of venue" clause is a clause that states where a dispute
is to be resolved (e.g., which court). Many OSS licenses do not have a
choice of venue clause, and thus cannot have an issue.

If your contract has FAR clause 52.212-4 (which it is normally required
to do), then choice of venue clauses in software licenses are
undesirable, but the order of precedence clause (in the contract) means
that the choice of venue clause (in the license) is superseded by the
Contract Disputes Act. Thus, in many cases a "choice of venue" clause is
not an insurmountable barrier to acceptance of the software delivery by
the government.

For software delivered under federal contracts, any "choice of venue"
clauses in the license generally conflict with the Contract Disputes
Act. However, the required FAR Clause 52.212-4(d) establishes that "This
contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41
U.S.C. 601-613)." Furthermore, 52.212-4(s) says: "(s) Order of
precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall
be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the
schedule of supplies/services; (2) the Assignments, Disputes, Payments,
Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to
Government Contracts paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at
52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any
license agreements for computer software; ..."

This clause establishes that the choice of venue clause (category 4) is
superseded by the Contract Disputes Act (category 2), and thus the
conflict is typically moot. Government lawyers and Contracting Officers
are trained to try to negotiate licenses which resolve these ambiguities
without having to rely on the less-satisfying "Order of Precedence", but
generally accede when licenses in question are non-negotiable, such as
with OSS licenses in many cases. As always, if there are questions,
consult your attorney to discuss your specific situation.

OSS and Security/Software Assurance/System Assurance/Supply Chain Risk Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q: Does the DoD use OSS for security functions?

Yes. The [2003 MITRE study, "Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
in the U.S. Department of
Defense"](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/dodfoss_pdf.pdf),
for analysis purposes, posed the hypothetical question of what would
happen if OSS software were banned in the DoD, and found that OSS "plays
a far more critical role in the DoD than has been generally
recognized... (especially in) Infrastructure Support, Software
Development, Security, and Research". In particular, it found that DoD
security "depends on (OSS) applications and strategies", and that a
hypothetic ban "would have immediate, broad, and in some cases strongly
negative impacts on the ability of the DoD to analyze and protect its
own networks against hostile intrusion. This is in part because such a
ban would prevent DoD groups from using the same analysis and network
intrusion applications that hostile groups could use to stage
cyberattacks. It would also remove the uniquely (OSS) ability to change
infrastructure source code rapidly in response to new modes of
cyberattack".

### Q: Doesn't hiding source code automatically make software more secure?

No. Indeed, vulnerability databases such as CVE make it clear that
merely hiding source code does not counter attacks:

-   Dynamic attacks (e.g., generating input patterns to probe for
    vulnerabilities and then sending that data to the program to
    execute) don’t need source or binary. Observing the output from
    inputs is often sufficient for attack.
-   Static attacks (e.g., analyzing the code instead of its execution)
    can use pattern-matches against binaries - source code is not needed
    for them either.
-   Even if source code is necessary (e.g., for source code analyzers),
    adequate source code can often be regenerated by disassemblers and
    decompilers sufficiently to search for vulnerabilities. Such source
    code may not be adequate to cost-effectively *maintain* the
    software, but attackers need not maintain software.
-   Even when the original source is necessary for in-depth analysis,
    making source code available to the public significantly aids
    defenders and not just attackers. Continuous and broad peer-review,
    enabled by publicly available source code, improves software
    reliability and security through the identification and elimination
    of defects that might otherwise go unrecognized by the core
    development team. Conversely, where source code is hidden from the
    public, attackers can attack the software anyway as described
    above.  In addition, an attacker can often acquire the original
    source code from suppliers anyway (either because the supplier
    voluntarily provides it, or via attacks against the supplier); in
    such cases, if only the attacker has the source code, the attacker
    ends up with another advantage.

Hiding source code *does* inhibit the ability of third parties to
respond to vulnerabilities (because changing software is more difficult
without the source code), but this is obviously *not* a security
advantage. In general, “Security by Obscurity” is widely denigrated.

This does *not* mean that the DoD will reject using proprietary COTS
products. There are valid business reasons, unrelated to security, that
may lead a commercial company selling proprietary software to choose to
hide source code (e.g., to reduce the risk of copyright infringement or
the revelation of trade secrets).  What it does mean, however, is that
the DoD will not reject consideration of a COTS product merely because
it is OSS. Some OSS is very secure, while others are not; some
proprietary software is very secure, while others are not. Each product
must be examined on its own merits.

### Q: What are indicators that a specific OSS program will have fewer unintentional vulnerabilities?

As noted in the [Secure Programming for Linux and Unix
HOWTO](http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html#OPEN-SOURCE-SECURITY-BOTTOM-LINE),
three conditions reduce the risks from unintentional vulnerabilities in
OSS:

1.  Developers/reviewers need security knowledge. Knowledge is moreimportant than the licensing scheme.
2.  People have to actually review the code.
    -   This has a reduced likelihood if the program is niche or
        rarely-used, has few developers, uses a rare computer
        language, or is not really OSS. Conversely, if it widely-used, has many developers, and so
        on, the likelihood of review increases. Examine if it is truly
        community-developed - or if there are only a very few
        developers.
    -   Review really does happen. Several static tool vendors support
        analysis of OSS (such as Coverity and Fortify) as a way to
        improve their tools and gain market use. There are many general
        OSS review projects, such as those by OpenBSD and the Debian
        Security Audit team. And of course, individual OSS projects
        often have security review processes or methods (such as
        Mozilla's bounty system). If there are reviewers from many
        different backgrounds (e.g., different countries), this can also
        reduce certain risks. When examining a specific OSS project,
        look for evidence that review (both by humans and tools) does
        take place.
3.  Problems must be fixed. It is far better to fix vulnerabilities before deployment - are such efforts occuring? When the software is already deployed, does the project develop and deploy fixes?

### Q: Is there a risk of malicious code becoming embedded into OSS?

The use of *any* commercially-available software, be it proprietary or
OSS, creates the risk of executing malicious code embedded in the
software.   Even if a commercial program did not originally have
vulnerabilities, both proprietary and OSS program binaries can be
modified (e.g., with a "hex editor" or virus) so that it includes
malicious code.  It may be illegal to modify proprietary software, but
that will normally not slow an attacker. Thankfully, there are ways to
reduce the risk of executing malicious code when using commercial
software (both proprietary and OSS).  It is impossible to completely
eliminate all risks; instead, focus on reducing risks to acceptable
levels.
 The use of software with a proprietary license provides absolutely no
guarantee that the software is free of malicious code. Indeed, many
people have released proprietary code that is malicious. What's more,
proprietary software release practices make it more difficult to be
confident that the software does not include malicious code.  Such
software does not normally undergo widespread public review, indeed, the
source code is typically not provided to the public and there are often
license clauses that attempt to inhibit review further (e.g., forbidding
reverse engineering and/or forbidding the public disclosure of analysis
results). Thus, to reduce the risk of executing malicious code,
potential users should consider the reputation of the supplier and the
experience of other users, prefer software with a large number of users,
and ensure that they get the "real" software and not an imitator.  
Where it is important, examining the security posture of the supplier
(e.g., their processes that reduce risk) and scanning/testing/evaluating
the software may also be wise.

Similarly, OSS (as well as proprietary software) may indeed have
malicious code embedded in it. However, such malicious code cannot be
directly inserted by "just anyone" into a well-established OSS project.
As noted above, OSS projects have a "trusted repository" that only
certain developers (the "trusted developers") can directly modify.  In
addition, since the source code is publicly released, anyone can review
it, including for the possibility of malicious code.  The public release
also makes it easy to have copies of versions in many places, and to
compare those versions, making it easy for many people to review
changes.  Many perceive this openness as an advantage for OSS, since OSS
better meets Saltzer & Schroeder's "Open design principle" ("the
protection mechanism must not depend on attacker ignorance").  This is
not merely theoretical; [in 2003 the Linux kernel development process
resisted an attack](http://www.linux.com/feature/32539).  Similarly,
SourceForge/Apache (in 2001) and Debian (in 2003) countered external
attacks.

 As with proprietary software, to reduce the risk of executing malicious
code, potential users should consider the reputation of the supplier
(the OSS project) and the experience of other users, prefer software
with a large number of users, and ensure that they get the "real"
software and not an imitator (e.g., from the main project site or a
trusted distributor). Where it is important, examining the security
posture of the supplier (the OSS project) and
scanning/testing/evaluating the software may also be wise.

The example of Borland's InterBase/Firebird is instructive. For at least
7 years, Borland's Interbase (a proprietary database program) had
embedded in it a "back door"; the username "politically", password
"correct", would immediately give the requestor complete control over
the database, a fact unknown to its users. Whether or not this was
intentional, it certainly had the same form as a malicious back door.
When the program was released as OSS, within 5 months this vulnerability
was found and fixed. This shows that proprietary software can include
functionality that could be described as malicious, yet remain unfixed -
and that at least in some cases OSS is reviewed and fixed.

Note that merely being released by a US firm is no guarantee that there
is no malicious embedded code.  First of all, being a US firm has little
relationship to the citizenship of its developers and its supplier's
developers. Also, US citizens can attempt to embed malicious code into
software, and many non-US citizens develop software without embedding
malicious code. In practice, commercial software (OSS or not) tends to
be developed globally, especially when you consider their developers and
supply chains. The good news is that, by definition, OSS provides its
source code, enabling a more informed evaluation than is typically
available for other kinds of COTS products.

Note also that merely being developed for the government is no guarantee
that there is no malicious embedded code.  Such developers need not be
cleared, for example.  Requiring that all developers be cleared first
can reduce certain risks (at substantial costs), where necessary, but
even then there is no guarantee.

Note that most commercial software is not intended to be used where the
impact of *any* error of any kind is *extremely* high (e.g., a large
number of lives are likely to be immediately lost if even the slightest
software error occurs).  Software that meets very high
reliability/security requirements, aka "high assurance" software, must
be specially designed to meet such requirements.  Most commercial
software (including OSS) is not designed for such purposes.

### Q: What is the country of origin for software?

The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has said, in an advisory ruling,
that the country of origin of software is the place where the software
is converted into object code (["Software comes from the place where
it's converted into object code, says CBP",
FierceGovernmentIT](http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/software-comes-place-where-its-converted-object-code-says-cbp/2012-12-06)),
for "purposes of granting waivers of certain 'Buy American' restrictions
in U.S. law or practice or products offered for sale to the U.S.
Government."

The [CBP
ruling](http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/sites/govit/software_cbpadvisoryruling_country_of_origin_talend.pdf)
points out that 19 U.S.C. § 2518(4)(B) says that, "An article is a
product of a country or instrumentality only if (i) it is wholly the
growth, product, or manufacture of that country or instrumentality, or
(ii) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of
materials from another country or instrumentality, it has been
substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce
with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or
articles from which it was so transformed." The CBP also pointed out a
ruling (Data General v. United States, 4 CIT 182 (1982)), that
programming a PROM performed a substantial transformation. Under the
same reasoning, the CBP determined that building an object file from
source code performed a substantial transformation into a new article.

Using OSS in DoD systems
------------------------

### Q: Does the DoD already use open source software?

Yes, extensively. The [2003 MITRE study, "Use of Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of
Defense"](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/dodfoss_pdf.pdf),
identified some of many OSS programs that the DoD is *already* using,
and concluded that OSS "plays a more critical role in the [Department of
Defense (DoD)] than has generally been recognized".

Intellipedia is implemented using MediaWiki, the open source software
developed to implement Wikipedia. This Open Source Software FAQ was
originally developed on Intellipedia, using a variety of web browsers
including Mozilla Firefox. Thus, this FAQ was developed using open
source software.

The DoD is, of course, not the only user of OSS. [Gartner Group's Mark
Driver stated in November
2010](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/docs/DoD_Briefing_1.12.12_Notes.pdf)
that, "Open source is ubiquitous, it's unavoidable... having a policy
against open source is impractical and places you at a competitive
disadvantage."

### Q: Is a lot of pre-existing open source software available?

Yes. Widely-used programs include the Apache web server, Firefox web
browser, Linux kernel, and many other programs. [Estimating the Total
Development Cost of a Linux
Distribution](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/estimatinglinux.php)
estimates that the Fedora 9 Linux distribution, which contains over
5,000 software packages, represents about $10.8 billion of development
effort.



### Q: Is there an "approved", "recommended" or "Generally Recognized as Safe/Mature" list of Open Source Software? What programs are already in widespread use?

No, the DoD does not have an official recommendation for any particular
OSS product or set of products, nor a "Generally Recognized as
Safe/Mature" list. The [2003 MITRE study, "Use of Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of
Defense"](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/dodfoss_pdf.pdf),
did suggest developing a "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) list, but
such a list has not been developed.

The US Army has a concept called
"[Networthiness](https://www.us.army.mil/suite/page/137030/)" and will
grant a "Certificate of Networthiness" to software that is approved for
use. There are various OSS applications which already have such
certification.

Commercial software (including OSS) that has widespread use often has
lower risk, since there are often good reasons for its widespread use.
The MITRE study did identify some of many OSS programs that the DoD is
*already* using, and may prove helpful. Examples of OSS that are in
widespread use include:

-   [Apache](http://www.apache.org) - Web server
-   Mozilla [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) - Web browser
-   Mozilla [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/),
    Evolution - Email client
-   [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org) - Office document suite
-   OpenSSH - Secure Shell
-   OpenSSL - SSL/cryptographic library implementation
-   bind - DNS server
-   Postfix, Sendmail - Mail servers
-   [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/) - Compiler suite
-   GNAT - Ada compiler suite (technically this is part of gcc)
-   perl, Python, PHP - Scripting languages
-   Samba - Windows - Unix/Linux interoperability
-   Mailman - mailing list manager
-   [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and
    [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) - Relational Database
    Management Systems
-   [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) - Bitmap graphics editor
-   [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) - Wiki


 There are many "Linux distributions" which provides suites of such
software such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Novell SuSE, Debian
and Ubuntu. Other open source software implementations of Unix
interfaces include Solaris, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD.

Again, these are examples, and not official endorsements of any
particular product or supplier.

### Q: Can I use an open source software program that is not on the Unified Capabilities Approved Products List ([UC-APL](https://aplits.disa.mil/))?

Yes.  The UC-APL is a list of *devices* (including embedded and related 
software components) that can be attached to a DoD network.  The APL 
is not intended to  address software-only solutions, and the requirement 
to only acquire products from the UC-APL is not applicable to software systems.

There are a number of approved devices that include open source software 
components.

### Q: What are some military-specific open source software programs?

Some more military-specific OSS programs used in the military include:

-   [FalconView](http://www.falconview.org/) - PC-based mapping
    application
-   Open Source Software for Imagery & Mapping
    ([OSSIM](http://www.ossim.org/OSSIM/OSSIM_Home.html)) - geospatial
    image viewing (with classified plugins)
-   OSSIM Mapping ARchieve System
    ([OMAR](http://www.ossim.org/OSSIM/OMAR.html)) - video indexing
-   [BRL-CAD](http://brlcad.org/) - solid modeling (Army)
-   [Optics](https://www.ballforge.net/) - MASINT toolset (with
    classfied plugins)
-   [Delta3D](http://www.delta3d.org/) - Game/Simulation engine for
    modeling and simulation (e.g., for military training/exercises)

There are many others.

### Q: How can I find open source software that meets my specific needs?

One approach is to use a general-purpose search engine (such as
[Google](http://www.google.com)) and type in your key functional
requirements. If you know of an existing proprietary product meets your
needs, searching for its name plus "open source source" may help.

If you are looking for an application that has wide use, one of the
various lists of "open source alternatives" may help. These include:

-   [Open Source Alternatives (Ben Balter et
    al.)](http://benbalter.github.com/open-source-alternatives/)
-   [Open Source as Alternative](http://www.osalt.com/)

If you are looking for smaller pieces of code to reuse, search engines
specifically for code may be helpful. Examples include:

-   [Grepcode.com](http://www.grepcode.com/)
-   [Koders.com](http://koders.com/)
-   [Google code search](http://code.google.com/codesearch)

If you know of others who have similar needs, ask them for leads.

### Q: Is there any quantitative evidence that open source software can be as good as (or better than) proprietary software?

Yes; [Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS)?
Look at the Numbers!](http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html) is a
survey paper that "provides [quantitative
data](quantitative data "wikilink") that, in many cases, using open
source software / free software (abbreviated as OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS)
is a reasonable or even superior approach to using their proprietary
competition according to various measures.. (its) goal is to show that
you should consider using OSS/FS when acquiring software". It points to
various studies related to market share, reliability, performance,
scalability, security, and total cost of ownership.

This is in addition to the advantages from OSS because it can be
reviewed, modified, and redistributed with few restrictions (inherent in
the definition of OSS).

That said, this does *not* mean that all OSS is superior to all
proprietary software in all cases by all measures. Each government
program must determine its needs, and then evaluate its options for
meeting those needs.

### Q: When a DoD contractor is developing a new system/software as a deliverable in a typical DoD contract, is it possible to include existing open source software?

Yes, it's possible. In nearly all cases pre-existing OSS are "commercial
components", and thus their use is governed by the rules for including
any commercial components in the deliverable. The use of commercial
components is generally encouraged, and when there are commercial
components, the government expects that it will normally use whatever
license is offered to the public. Depending on the contract and its
interpretation, contractors may be required to get governmental
permission to include commercial components in their deliverable; where
this applies, this would be true for OSS components as well as
proprietary components. As with all commercial items, organizations must
obey the terms of the commercial license, negotiate a different license
if necessary, or not use the commercial item.

An alternative is to not *include* the OSS component in the deliverable,
but simply *depend* on it, as long as that is acceptable to the
government. This is often done when the deliverable is a software
application; instead of including commercially-available components such
as the operating system or database system as part of the deliverable,
the deliverable could simply state what it requires.

### Q: When a DoD contractor is developing a new system/software as a deliverable in a typical DoD contract, is it possible to use existing software licensed using the GNU General Public License (GPL)? Can the DoD used GPL-licensed software?

Yes. There is no DoD policy forbidding or limiting the use of software
licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

The DoD already uses a wide variety of software licensed under the GPL.
A [2003 MITRE study, "Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the
U.S. Department of
Defense"](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/dodfoss_pdf.pdf),
identified many OSS programs that the DoD is *already* using that are
licensed using the GPL. These included the Linux kernel, the gcc
compilation suite (including the GNAT Ada compiler), the OpenOffice.org
office suite, the emacs text editor, the Nmap network scanner, OpenSSH
and OpenSSH for encryption, and Samba for Unix/Linux/Windows
interoperability. This should not be surprising; the DoD uses OSS
extensively, and the GPL is the most popular OSS license.

As with all commercial items, the DoD must comply with the item's
license when using the item. There are two versions of the GPL in
widespread use: version 2 and version 3. The key issue with both
versions of the GPL is that, unlike most other OSS licenses, the GPL
licenses require that a recipient of a binary (executable) must be able
to demand and receive the source code of that program, and the recipient
must also be able to propogate the work under that license. The Free
Software Foundation (FSF) interprets linking a GPL program with another
program as creating a derivative work, and thus imposing this license
term in such cases.

In most cases, this GPL license term is not a problem. After all, most
proprietary software licenses explicitly forbid modifying (or even
reverse-engineering) the program, so the GPL actually provides
*additional* rights not present in most proprietary software. So if the
program is being used and not modified (a very common case), this
additional term has no impact. Even for many modifications (e.g., bug
fixes) this causes no issues because in many cases the DoD has no
interest in keeping those changes confidential.

However, if the GPL software must be mixed with other
proprietary/classified software, the GPL terms must still be followed.

### Q: Under what conditions can GPL-licensed software be mixed with proprietary/classified software?

Software licensed under the GPL *can* be mixed with software released
under other licenses, and mixed with classified or export-controlled
software, but only under conditions that do not violate any license.
Such mixing can sometimes only occur when certain kinds of separation
are maintained - and thus this can become a design issue.

The [2003 MITRE study section
1.3.4](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/dodfoss_pdf.pdf)
outlines several ways to legally mix GPL with proprietary or classified
software:

-   Distribution Mixing – GPL and other software can be stored and
    transmitted together. Example: GPL software can be stored on the
    same computer disk as (most kinds of) proprietary software.
-   Execution Mixing – GPL and other software can run at the same time
    on the same computer or network. Example: GPL and (unrelated)
    proprietary applications can be running at the same time on a
    desktop PC.
-   Application Mixing – GPL can rely on other software to provide it
    with services, provided either that those services are either
    generic (e.g., operating system services) or have been explicitly
    exempted by the GPL software designer as non-GPL components.
    Examples include GPL applications running on proprietary operating
    systems or wrappers, and GPL applications that use proprietary
    components explicitly marked as non-GPL. Windows Services for UNIX
    3.0 is a good example of commercial use of GPL application mixing.
-   Service Mixing – GPL can provide generic services to other software.
    These services must be genuinely generic in the sense that the
    applications that use them must not depend on the detailed design of
    the GPL software to work. An example is (connecting) a GPL utility
    to a proprietary software component by using the Unix "pipe"
    mechanism, which allows one-way flow of data to move between
    software components. This is the tightest form of mixing possible
    with GPL and other types of software, but it must be used with care
    to ensure that the GPL software remains generic and is not tightly
    bound to any one proprietary software component.

Often such separation can occur by separating information into data and
a program that uses it, or by defining distinct layers. As long as a GPL
program does not embed GPL software into its outputs, a GPL program can
process classified/proprietary information without question. Thus,
GPL'ed compilers can compile classified programs (since the compilers
treat the classified program as data), and a GPL'ed implementation of a
virtual machine (VM) can execute classified software (since the VM
implementation runs the software as data). Many development tools
covered by the GPL include libraries and runtimes that are not covered
by the GPL itself but the GPL with a runtime exception (e.g., the
CLASSPATH exception) that specifically permits development of
proprietary software. A GPL'ed "engine" program can be controlled by
classified data that it reads without issue. A GPL'ed program can run on
top of a classified/proprietary platform when the platform is a separate
"System Library" (as defined in GPL version 3). Note that enforcing such
separation has many other advantages as well.

The U.S. government can often directly combine GPL and proprietary,
classified, or export-controlled software into a single program
arbitrarily, as long as the result is never conveyed outside the U.S.
government. However, this approach should not be taken lightly. This
approach may inhibit later release of the combined result to other
parties (e.g., allies), as release to an ally probably would in many
cases be considered distribution. In some cases, export controlled
software may be permitted under the condition that the source code not
be released; this would prevent release of software that had mixed GPL
and export-controlled software. When taking this approach, contractors
hired to modify the software must not retain copyright or other rights
to the result (else the software would be conveyed outside the U.S.
government); see [GPL version 3 section 2, paragraph
2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) which states this
explicitly. Where possible, it may be better to divide such components
into smaller components in a way that avoids this issue.

It can be argued that classified software can be arbitrarily combined
with GPL code, beyond the approaches described above. The argument is
that the classification rules are simply laws of the land (and not
"additional" rules), the classification rules already forbid the release
of the resulting binaries to those without proper clearances, and that
the GPL only requires that source code be released to those who received
a binary. While this argument may be valid, we know of no general
counsel ruling confirming this. Anyone who is considering this approach
should obtain a ruling from general counsel first (and please let the
FAQ authors know!).

If a legal method for using the GPL software for a particular
application cannot be devised, and a different license cannot be
negotiated, then the GPL-licensed component cannot be used for that
particular purpose. Note that this also applies to proprietary software,
which often have even stricter limits on if/how the software may be
changed.

### Q: Is the GPL compatible with Government Unlimited Rights contracts, or does the requirement to display the license, etc, violate Government Unlimited Rights contracts?

The GPL and government "unlimited rights" terms have similar goals, but
differ in details. This isn't usually an issue because of how typical
DoD contract clauses work under the DFARS.

Any software that has a non-government use and is licensed to the public
is *commercial software*, by definition, including OSS programs licensed
to the government using the GPL. Normally the government only expects to
get the usual commercial rights to commercial software, and not
"unlimited rights". So if the software displays a license in a way that
can't be legally disabled (as required by the GPL), there is no problem,
because this is an ordinary commercial software license term. The same
would be true if you used Microsoft Windows; you aren't normally
permitted to disable the rights-display functions of Microsoft Windows
either.

In contrast, the government normally gets "unlimited rights" only when
it pays for development of that software, in full or in part. Software
developed by government funding would typically be termed "noncommercial
software", and thus falls under different rules. The government *does*
have the right to take software it has unlimited rights to, and link it
with GPL software. After all, the government can use unlimited rights
software in any way it wishes.

Once the government has unlimited rights, it can release that software
to the public in any it wishes - including by using the GPL. This is not
a contradiction; it's quite common for different organizations to have
different rights to the same software. The program available to the
public may improve over time, through contributions not paid for by the
U.S. government. In that case, the U.S. government can choose to use the
version to which it has unlimited rights, or it can use the
publicly-available commercial version available to the government
through that version's commercial license (the GPL in this case).

### Q: Does the Antideficiency act (ADA) prohibit all use of OSS due to limitations on voluntary services?

No. Relevant government authorities make it clear that the
Antideficiency Act (ADA) does not generally prohibit the use of OSS due
to limitations on voluntary services. Instead, the ADA prohibits
government employees from accepting services that are not intended or
agreed to be gratuitous, but were instead rendered in the hope that
Congress will subsequently recognize a moral obligation to pay for the
benefits conferred.

Part of the ADA, Pub.L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 923, is in
[31 U.S.C. § 1342, Limitation on voluntary services](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1342). This statute says
that, “An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the
District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for
either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized
by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the
protection of property. This section does not apply to a corporation
getting amounts to make loans (except paid in capital amounts) without
legal liability of the United States Government...”

The [US Government Accountability Office (GAO) Office of the General
Counsel’s “Principles of Federal Appropriations Law” (aka the “Red
Book”)](http://www.gao.gov/legal/redbook/redbook.html) explains federal
appropriation law. Volume II of its third edition, section 6.C.3,
describes in detail this prohibition on voluntary services. Section
6.C.3.a notes that the voluntary services provision is not new; it first
appeared, in almost identical form, back in 1884. The red book explains
its purpose; since “an agency cannot directly obligate in excess or
advance of its appropriations, it should not be able to accomplish the
same thing indirectly by accepting ostensibly ‘voluntary’ services and
then presenting Congress with the bill, in the hope that Congress will
recognize a ‘moral obligation’ to pay for the benefits conferred...”

The red book section 6.C.3.b explains this prohibition in more detail.
It states that in 1913, the Attorney General developed an opinion (30
Op. Att’y Gen. 51 (1913)) that “has become the leading case construing
31 U.S.C. § 1342... the Attorney General drew a distinction that the
Comptroller of the Treasury thereafter adopted, and that GAO and the
Justice Department continue to follow to this day—the distinction
between ‘voluntary services’ and ‘gratuitous services.’” Some key text
from this opinion, as identified by the red book, are:

“[I]t seems plain that the words ‘voluntary service’ were not intended
to be synonymous with ‘gratuitous service’ ... it is evident that the
evil at which Congress was aiming was not appointment or employment for
authorized services without compensation, but the acceptance of
unauthorized services not intended or agreed to be gratuitous and
therefore likely to afford a basis for a future claim upon Congress. . .
.”

More recent decisions, such as [the 1982 decision B-204326 by the U.S.
Comptroller General](http://www.gao.gov/assets/450/441639.pdf), continue
to confirm this distinction between “gratuitous” and “voluntary”
service.

In short, the ADA’s limitation on voluntary services does not broadly
forbid the government from working with organizations and people who
identify themselves as volunteers, including those who develop OSS.
Instead, Government employees must ensure that they do not accept
services rendered in the hope that Congress will subsequently recognize
a moral obligation to pay for the benefits conferred. Services that are
intended and agreed to be gratuitous do not conflict with this statute.
In most cases, contributors to OSS projects intend for their
contributions to be gratuitous, and provide them for all (not just for
the Federal government), clearly distinguishing such OSS contributions
from the “voluntary services” that the ADA was designed to prevent.

### Q: How can I evaluate OSS options?

OSS options should be evaluated in principle the same way you would
evaluate any option, considering need, cost, and so on. In some cases,
the sources of information for OSS differ.

Be sure to consider total cost of ownership (TCO), not just initial
download costs. Even if OSS has no cost to download, there is still a
cost for OSS due to installation, support, and so on (whether done
in-house or through external organizations). Be sure to consider such
costs over a period of time (typically the lifetime of the system
including its upgrades), and use the same period when evaluating
alternatives; otherwise, one-time costs (such as costs to transition
from an existing proprietary system) can lead to erroneous conclusions.
Include upgrade/maintenance costs, including indirect costs (such as
hardware replacement if necessary to run updated software), in the TCO.
 By definition, open source software provides more rights to users than
proprietary software (at least in terms of use, modification, and
distribution). That said, other factors may be more important for a
given circumstance.

The DoD does not have a single required process for evaluating OSS. The
following externally-developed evaluation processes or tips may be of
use:

### Q: How can I migrate to OSS?

Migrating from an existing system to an OSS approach requires addressing
the same issues that any migration involves.

[The IDA Open Source Migration
Guidelines](http://www.netproject.com/docs/migoss/) recommend:

-   before starting have a clear understanding of the reasons to
    migrate;
-   ensure that there is active support for the change from IT staff and
    users;
-   make sure that there is a champion for change – the higher up in the
    organisation the better;
-   build up expertise and relationships with the OSS movement;
-   start with non critical systems;
-   ensure that each step in the migration is manageable.

It also suggests that the following questions need to be addressed:

-   how to ensure the interoperability of systems;
-   how to support mobile users;
-   how to securely identify remote users;
-   how to build systems that are manageable.
-   ensure that security is designed in from the start and not tacked on
    as an after thought.

It also recommends ensuring "that decisions made now, even if they do
not relate directly to a migration, should not further tie an
Administration to proprietary file formats and protocols". It also notes
that OSS is a disruptive technology, in particular, that it is "a move
away from a product to a service based industry".

### Q: How can I get support for OSS that already exists?

You can support OSS either through a commercial organization, or you can
self-support OSS; in either case, you can use community support as an
aid.

Commercial support can either be through companies with specialize in
OSS support (in general or for specific products), or through
contractors who specialize in supporting customers and provide the OSS
support as part of a larger service. Examples of the former include Red
Hat, Novell, HP, Oracle, IBM, DMSolutions, SourceLabs, OpenLogic,
Carahsoft, and Mozilla.

Some have found that community support can be very helpful. The 1997
InfoWorld “Best Technical Support” award was won by the "Linux User
Community". However, you should examine past experience and your
intended uses before depending on this as a primary mechanism for
support.

### Q: Am I required to have commercial support for OSS?

No, DoD policy does not require you to have commercial support for OSS,
but you must have *some* plan for support. The 2009 DoD CIO memo on open
source software says, in attachment 2, 2(d), "The use of any software
without appropriate maintenance and support presents an information
assurance risk. Before approving the use of software (including OSS),
system/program managers, and ultimately Designated Approving Authorities
(DAAs), must ensure that the plan for software support (e.g., commercial
or Government program office support) is adequate for mission need."
Note that Government program office support is specifically identified
as a possibly-appropriate approach.

As noted in the article [Open Source memo doesn't mandate a support
vendor (by David Perera, FierceGovernmentIT, May 23,
2012)](http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/dod-official-open-source-memo-doesnt-mandate-support-vendor/2012-05-23),
the intent "of the memo was not to issue a blanket requirement that all
open source software come bundled with contractor support or else it
can't be used... If a Defense agency is able to sustain the open source
software with 'its own skills and talents' then that can be enough to
satisfy the intent of the memo." In addition, "How robust the support
plan need be can also vary on the nature of the software itself... For
command and control software, the degree would have to be greater than
for something that's not so critical to mission execution...".

Community OSS support is technically not enough by *itself* to provide
this support, because the OSS community cannot patch your servers or
workstations for you. However, support from in-house staff, augmented by
the OSS community, may be (and often is) sufficient. However, if you're
going to rely on the OSS community, you must make sure that the OSS
community for that product is active, and that you have suitably
qualified staff to implement the upgrades/enhancements developed by the
community.

If you have concerns about using in-house staff, augmented by the OSS
community for those components, then select and pay a commercial
organization to provide the necessary support. Many programs and DAAs do
choose to use commercial support, and in many cases that is the best
approach. However, using a support vendor is not the only approach or
the best approach in all cases; system/program managers and DAAs must
look at the specific situation to make a determination.

### Q: How do GOTS, Proprietary COTS, and OSS COTS compare?

Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS), proprietary commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS), and OSS COTS are all methods to enable reuse of software across
multiple projects.  Thus, they are all strategies for sharing the
development and maintenance costs of software, potentially reducing its
cost.

GOTS is especially appropriate when the software *must not* be released
to the public (e.g., it is classified) or when licenses forbid more
extensive sharing (e.g., the government only has government-purpose
rights to the software). If the software is not released to the public
at all and it provides a direct military advantage, then the U.S.
military (and its allies) may obtain a distinct military advantage (note
that such software would normally be classified).  Unlike proprietary
COTS, GOTS has the advantage that the government has the right to change
the software whenever the government chooses to do so. Unfortunately,
the government must pay for *all* development and maintenance costs of
GOTS; since these can be substantial, GOTS runs the risk of becoming
obsolescent when the government cannot afford those costs. Also, since
there are a limited number of users, there is limited opportunity to
gain from user innovation - which again can lead to obsolescence.  Even
where there is GOTS/classified software, such software is typically only
a *portion* of the entire system, with other components implemented
through COTS components.

 Proprietary COTS is especially appropriate when there is an existing
proprietary COTS product that meets the need. Proprietary COTS tend to
be lower cost than GOTS, since the cost of development and maintenance
is typically shared among a larger number of users (who typically pay to
receive licenses to use the product). Unfortunately, this typically
trades off flexibility; the government typically does not have the right
to modify the software, so it often cannot fix serious security
problems, add arbitrary improvements, or make the software work on
platforms of its choosing.  If the supplier attains a monopoly or it is
difficult to switch from the supplier, the costs may skyrocket.  What is
more, the supplier may choose to abandon the product; software escrow
can reduce these risks somewhat, but in these cases it becomes GOTS with
its attendant costs.
 OSS COTS is especially appropriate when there is an existing OSS COTS
product that meets the need, or one can be developed and supported by a
wide range of users/co-developers.  OSS COTS tends to be lower cost than
GOTS, in part for the same reasons as proprietary COTS: its costs are
shared among more users.  It also often has lower total
cost-of-ownership than proprietary COTS, since acquiring it initially is
often free or low-cost, and all other support activities (training,
installation, modification, etc.) can be competed.  Its flexibility is
as high as GOTS, since it can be arbitrarily modified.  However, note
that this cost discussion only applies if there are many users; if no
user/co-developer community is built up, then it can be as costly as
GOTS.

### Q: What are the risks of failing to consider the use of OSS components or approaches?

For the DoD, the risks of failing to consider the use of OSS where
appropriate are of increased cost, increased schedule, and/or reduced
performance (including reduced innovation or security) to the DoD due to
the failure to use the commercial software that best meets the needs
(when that is the case). It also risks reduced flexibility (including
against cyberattack), since OSS permits arbitrary later modification by
users in ways that some other license approaches do not. In addition,
ignoring OSS would not be lawful; U.S. law specifically requires
consideration of commercial software (including extant OSS, regardless
of exactly which license it uses), and specifically instructs
departments to pass this requirement to consider commercial items down
to contractors and their suppliers at all tiers.

DoD contractors who always ignore components because they are OSS, or
because they have a particular OSS license they don't prefer, risk
losing projects to more competitive bidders. If that competitor's use of
OSS results in an advantage to the DoD (such as lower cost, faster
schedule, increased performance, or other factors such as increased
flexibility), contractors should expect that the DoD will choose the
better bid. This does not mean that existing OSS elements should always
be chosen, but it means that they must be considered.

### Q: Is there a large risk that widely-used OSS unlawfully includes proprietary software (in violation of copyright)?

No; this is a low-probability risk for widely-used OSS programs. A
primary reason that this is low-probability is the publicity of the OSS
source code itself (which almost invariably includes information about
those who made specific changes). Any company can easily review OSS to
look for proprietary code that should not be there; there are even OSS
tools that can find common code. A company that found any of its
proprietary software in an OSS project can in most cases quickly
determine who unlawfully submitted that code and sue that person for
infringement.

In addition, widely-used licenses and OSS projects often include
additional mechanisms to counter this risk. The GPL and LGPL licenses
specifically recommend that "You should also get your employer (if you
work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a 'copyright
disclaimer' for the program, if necessary.", and point to additional
information. Many projects, particularly the large number of projects
managed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), ask for an employer's
disclaimer from the contributor's employer in a number of circumstances.
The Linux kernel project requires that a person proposing a change add a
"Signed-off-by" tag, attesting that the "patch, to the best of his or
her knowledge, can legally be merged into the mainline and distributed
under the terms of (the license)."

In practice, OSS projects tend to be remarkably clean of such issues.
For example, a [Code Analysis of the Linux Wireless Team's ath5k
Driver](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/ath5k-code-analysis.html)
found no license problems.

When considering any software (OSS or proprietary), look for evidence
that the risk of unlawful release is low. Factors that greatly reduce
this risk include:

-   Widespread availability and use of the software (which increases the
    likelihood of detection)
-   Configuration management systems that record the identity of
    individual contributors (which acts as a deterrent)
-   Licenses or development policies that warn against the unlawful
    inclusion of material, or require people to specifically assert that
    they are acting lawfully (which reduce the risk of unintentional
    infringement)
-   Lack of evidence of infrigement (e.g., an Internet search for
    project name + "copyright infringement" turns up nothing).  Parties
    are innocent until proven guilty, so if there *is* such a charge,
    investigate the charges' merits instead of presuming guilt.

### Q: Is there a large risk to DoD contractors that widely-used OSS violates enforceable software patents?

Typically not, though the risk varies depending on their contract and
specific circumstance. Note, however, that this risk has little to do
with OSS, but is instead rooted in the risks of U.S. patent infringement
for *all* software, and the patent indemnification clauses in their
contract.

It is difficult for software developers (OSS or not) to be confident
that they have avoided software patent infringement in the United
States, for a variety of reasons. Software might not infringe on a
patent when it was released, yet the same software may later infringe on
a patent if the patent was granted after the software's release. Many
software developers find software patents difficult to understand,
making it difficult for them to determine if a given patent even applies
to a given program. Patent examiners have relatively little time to
review each patent, and do not have effective access to most prior art
in software, which may lead them to grant patents for
previously-published inventions or "obvious" inventions. The U.S. has
granted a large number of software patents, making it difficult and
costly to examine all of them. Recent rulings have strengthened the
requirement for "non-obviousness", which probably renders unenforceable
some already-granted software patents, but at this time it is difficult
to determine which ones are affected. As a result, it is difficult to
develop software and be confident that it does not violate enforceable
patents. The DoD has not expressed a position on whether or not software
should be patented, but it *is* interested in ensuring that software
that effectively supports its missions can be developed in a
cost-effective, timely, and legal manner.

U.S. government contractors (including those in the DoD) are often
indemnified from patent infringement by the U.S. government as part of
their contract. This greatly reduces contractors' risks, enabling them
to get work done (given this complex environment). They can obtain this
by receiving certain authorization clauses in their contracts. [FAR
52.227-1 (Authorization and
Consent)](http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/52_227.html), as
prescribed by [FAR
27.201-2(a)(1)](http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2027_2.html#wp1035008),
inserts the clause that the "Government authorizes and consents to all
use and manufacturer... of any invention (covered by) U.S. patent". The
related FAR 52.227-2 (Notice and Assistance Regarding Patent and
Copyright Infringement), as prescribed by FAR 27.201-2(b), requires the
contractor to report to the Contracting Officer each notice or claim of
patent/copyright infrigement in reasonable written detail. Specific
patents can also be authorized using clause FAR 52.227-5 or via listed
exceptions of FAR 52.227-3. See also [DFARS subpart 227.70--infringement
claims, licenses, and
assignments](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/227_70.htm)
and
[28 USC 1498](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00001498----000-.html).

As noted in [DFARS
27.201-1](http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2027_2.html#wp1035008),
"Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1498, the exclusive remedy for patent or
copyright infringement by or on behalf of the Government is a suit for
monetary damages against the Government in the Court of Federal Claims.
There is no injunctive relief available, and there is no direct cause of
action against a contractor that is infringing a patent or copyright
with the authorization or consent of the Government (e.g., while
performing a contract)."

There are other ways to reduce the risk of software patent infringement
(in the U.S.) as well:

-   Some protocols and formats have been specifically devised and
    reviewed to avoid patents; using them is more likely to avoid
    problems.
-   Prior art invalidates patents. Patents expire after 20 years, so any
    idea ("invention") implemented in software publicly available for
    more than 20 years should not, in theory, be patentable. Once an
    invention is released to the public, the inventor has only one year
    to file for a patent, so any new ideas in some software must have a
    patent filed within one year by that inventor, or (in theory) they
    cannot be patented. See [Prior Art and Its Uses: A Primer, by
    Theodore C.
    McCullough](http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20060414004039219)
-   OSS can often be purchased (directly, or as a support contract), and
    such purchases often include some sort of indemnification.
-   Various organizations have been formed to reduce patent risks for
    OSS. The [Open Invention
    Network](http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/) (OIN^SM^) may in some
    cases provide some additional protection. OIN purchases patent
    rights; patents owned by OIN are available royalty-free to any
    company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its
    patents against the "Linux System" (which includes a large set of
    OSS projects). [The Linux Foundations' Patent
    Commons](http://www.patentcommons.org/) forum is a neutral forum
    where patent pledges and other commitments can be readily accessed
    and easily understood.

### Q: How can I avoid failure to comply with an OSS license? What are good practices for use of OSS in a larger system?

The following are good practices:

-   Educate all software developers that they must comply with all valid
    licenses - including both proprietary *and* open source software
    licenses. Explain the basic terms of the most common OSS licenses to
    them.
-   Before including *any* software in a larger system (be it
    proprietary *or* OSS), review its license to ensure that the license
    will not impede anticipated uses.
-   When including externally-developed software in a larger system
    (e.g., as a library), make it clearly separable from the other
    components and easy to update. Commercial software (both proprietary
    and OSS) is occasionally updated to fix errors (including security
    vulnerabilities), and your system should be designed so that it is
    relatively easy to accept these updates.
-   Document from where and when any external software was acquired, as
    well as the license conditions, so that future users and maintainers
    can easily comply with the license terms.

### Q: What are the risks of the government releasing software as OSS?

The key risk is the revelation of information that should not be
released to the public. Classified software should *already* be marked
as such, of course. This risk is mitigated by reviewing software (in
particular, for classification and export control issues) before public
release.

### Q: What are the risks of the government *not* releasing software as OSS?

If the government modifies existing OSS, but fails to release those
improvements back to the main OSS project, it risks:

-   Greatly increased costs, due to the effort of self-maintaining its
    own version
-   Inability to use improvements (including security patches and
    innovations) by others, where it uses a "non-standard" version
    instead of the version being actively maintained

Similarly, if the government develops new software but does not release
it as OSS, it risks:

-   Greatly increased cost, due to having to bear the *entire* burden of
    development costs
-   Inability to use improvements (including security patches and
    innovations) by others, since they do not have the opportunity to
    aid in its development
-   Obsolescence due to the development and release of a competing
    commercial (e.g., OSS) project. In this case, the government has the
    unenviable choice of (1) spending possibly large sums to switch to
    the new project (which would typically have a radically different
    interface and goals), or (2) continuing to use the government-unique
    custom solution, which typically becomes obsolete and leaves the
    U.S. systems far less capable that others' (including those of U.S.
    adversaries)
-   Questions about why the government - who represents "the people" -
    is not releasing software (that the people paid for) back to the
    people.

Clearly, classified software cannot be released back to the public as
open source software. However, often software can be split into various
components, some of which are classified and some of which are not, and
it is to these *unclassified* portions that this text addresses.

### Q: When can the U.S. federal government or its contractors publicly release, as OSS, software developed with government funds?

"Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)" states that
"Software items, including code fixes and enhancements, developed for
the Government should be released to the public (such as under an open
source license) when all of the following conditions are met:

1.  The project manager, program manager, or other comparable official
    determines that it is in the Government’s interest to do so, such as
    through the expectation of future enhancements by others.
2.  The Government has the rights to reproduce and release the item, and
    to authorize others to do so. For example, the Government has public
    release rights when the software is developed by Government
    personnel, when the Government receives "unlimited rights" in
    software developed by a contractor at Government expense, or when
    pre-existing OSS is modified by or for the Government.
3.  The public release of the item is not restricted by other law or
    regulation, such as the Export Administration Regulations or the
    International Traffic in Arms Regulation, and the item qualifies for
    Distribution Statement A, per DoD Directive 5230.24 (reference
    (i))."

The government or contractor must determine the answer to these
questions:

1.  . What contract applies, what are its terms, and what decisions have
    been made?
2.  . Do you have the necessary copyright-related rights?
3.  . Do you have the necessary other intellectual rights (e.g.,
    patents)?
4.  . Do you have permission to release to the public (classification,
    distribution statements, export controls)?
5.  . Do you have the materials (e.g., source code) and are all
    materials properly marked?

Source: [Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the U.S.
Government](http://journal.thedacs.com/issue/56/180).

The following questions discuss some specific cases.

### Q: Can government employees develop software as part of their official duties and release it under an open source license?

Not under typical open source software licenses based on copyright, but
there is an alternative with the same practical effect.

Software developed by US federal government employees (including
military personnel) as part of their official duties is not subject to
copyright protection in the US (see 17 USC § 105). Software not subject
to copyright is often called “public domain” software. Public domain
software (in this copyright-related sense) can be used by anyone for any
purpose, and cannot by itself be released under a copyright license
(including typical open source software licenses).

However, software written entirely by federal government employees as
part of their official duties *can* be released as “public domain”
software. This is not a copyright license, it is the *absence* of a
license. By some definitions this is technically not an open source
license, because no license is needed, but such “public domain” software
can be legally used, modified, and combined with other software without
restriction. Thus, “public domain” software provides recipients all of
the rights that open source software must provide. An example of such
software is [Expect](http://expect.nist.gov/), which was developed and
released by NIST as public domain software. Note that under the DoD
definition of open source software, such public domain software *is*
open source software.

Note that when government employees develop software as part of their
official duties, it *can* be protected by copyright in other countries,
but note that these can only be enforced outside the US. Also, there are
rare exceptions for NIST and the US Postal Service employees where a US
copyright can be obtained (see [CENDI's Frequently Asked Questions About
Copyright](http://www.cendi.gov/publications/04-8copyright.html)).

Government employees may also modify existing open source software. If
some portion of the software is protected by copyright, then the
combined software work can be released under a copyright license. (See
next question.)

(See also [GPL FAQ, Question "Can the US Government release a program
under the GNU GPL?"](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLUSGov))

### Q: Can government employees contribute code to open source software projects?

Yes, but the following considerations apply:

As stated above, software developed by government employees as part of
their official duties is not subject to copyright protection in the
United States. If a government employee enhances or modifies a
(copyrighted) open source software program, the resulting work is a
“joint work” (see 17 USC § 101) which is partially copyrighted and
partially public domain. The resulting joint work as a whole is
protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and may be
released according to the terms of the original open-source license.

However, the public domain portions may be extracted from such a joint
work and used by anyone for any purpose. For computer software, modern
version control and source code comparison tools typically make it easy
to isolate the contributions of individual authors (via "blame" or
"annote" functions).

(See also [Free Software Foundation License List, Public
Domain](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#PublicDomain))

(See also [GPL FAQ, Question "Can the US Government release improvements
to a GPL-covered
program?"](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLUSGovAdd))

### Q: Can contractors develop software for the government and then release it under an open source license?

In many cases, yes, but this depends on the specific contract and
circumstances. Under the "default" DFARS and FAR rules and processes,
the contractor often keeps and exercise the rights of a copyright
holder, which enables them to release that software as open source
software (as long as other laws and regulations are met).

For DoD contractors, if the standard DFARS contract clauses are used (in
particular DFARS 252.227-7014) then the contractor who developed the
software retains the copyright to the software and has the right to
release it to others, even if the software was developed exclusively
with government funds. In some cases a DoD contractor may be required to
transfer copyright to the government for works produced under contract
(see DFARS 252.227-7020). If this is the case, then the contractor
cannot release the software as OSS without permission, because the
contractor doesn't own the copyright.

Contractors for other federal agencies may have a different process to
use, but after going through a process they can often release such
software as open source software. If the contract includes the typical
FAR 52.227-14 (Rights in data - general) clause, without any special
alternatives or additions, then the contractor must make a written
request for permission to assert copyright in works containing data
first produced under the contract. As described in FAR 27.404-3(a)(2), a
contracting officer should grant such a request only “when [that] will
enhance appropriate dissemination or use” but release as open source
software would typically qualify as a justification for enhanced
dissemination and use. Certain FAR clause alternatives (such as FAR
52.227-17) require the contractor to assign the copyright to the
government. Again, if this is the case, then the contractor cannot
release the software as OSS without permission, because the contractor
doesn't own the copyright.

There are many alternative clauses in the FAR and DFARS, and specific
contracts can (and often do) have different agreements on who has which
rights to software developed under a government contract. The FAR and
DFARS specifically permit different agreements to be struck (within
certain boundaries). Thus, if there is an existing contract, you *must*
check the contract to determine the specific situation; the text above
merely describes common cases.

Contractors must still abide with all other laws before being allowed to
release anything to the public. Obviously, contractors cannot release
anything (including software) to the public if it is classified. The
release of the software may be restricted by the International Traffic
in Arms Regulation or Export Administration Regulation. The release may
also be limited by patent and trademark law.

### Q: Can the government release software under an open source license if it was developed by contractors under government contract?

In many cases, yes, but this depends on the specific contract and
circumstances. The government can typically release software as open
source software once it has "unlimited rights" to the software. The
usual DoD contract clause (DFARS 252.227-7014) permits this by default.
The usual federal non-DoD clause (FAR 52.227-14) also permits this by
default as long as the government has not granted the contractor the
right to assert copyright. If the government has received copyright
(e.g., because the FAR 52.227-17 or DFARS 252.227-7020 clauses apply)
then the government can release the software as open source software.

Under the DFARS or the FAR, the government can release software as open
source software once it receives "unlimited rights" to that software.
DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(15) defines "unlimited rights" as "rights to use,
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer
software or computer software documentation in whole or in part, in any
manner and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others
to do so". As noted in "Technical Data and Computer Software: A Guide to
Rights and Responsibilities Under Federal Contracts, Grants and
Cooperative Agreements" by the Council on Governmental Relations (CAGR),
"This unlimited license enables the government to act on its own behalf
and to authorize others to do the same things that it can do, thus
giving the government essentially the same rights as the copyright
owner." In short, once the government has unlimited rights, it has
essentially the same rights as a copyright holder, and can then use
those rights to release that software under a variety of conditions
(including an open source software license), because it has the use and
modify the software at will, *and* has the right to authorize others to
do so.

If the standard DFARS contract clauses are used (see DFARS
252.227-7014), then unless other arrangements are made, the government
has unlimited rights to a software component when (1) it pays entirely
for the development of it (see DFARS 252.227-7014(b)(1)(i)), or (2) it
is five years after contract signature if it partly paid for its
development (see DFARS 252.227-7014(b)(2)). Before award, a contractor
may identify the components that will have more restrictive rights
(e.g., so the government can prefer proposals that give the government
more rights), and under limited conditions the list can be modified
later (e.g., for error correction). Where possible, software developed
partly by government funds should broken into a set of smaller
components at the "lowest practicable level" so the rules can be applied
separately to each one. Note, however, that this may be negotiated; if
the government agrees to only receive lesser rights (such as
government-purpose rights or restricted rights) then the government does
*not* have the rights necessary to release that software as open source
software.

The rules for many other U.S. departments may be very different.
Contracts under the federal government FAR, but not the DFARS, often use
clause FAR 52.227-14 (Rights in Data - General). By default, the
government has the necessary rights if it does not permit the contractor
to assert copyright, but it loses those rights if the government permits
the contractor to assert copyright.

If the contractor was required to transfer copyright to the government
for works produced under contract (e.g., because the FAR 52.227-17 or
DFARS 252.227-7020 clauses apply to it), then the government can release
the software as open source software, because the government owns the
copyright. The [NASA FAR Supplement (NFS)
1852.227-14](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/5227.htm)
gives NASA the right, under typical conditions, to demand that a
contractor assert copyright and then assign the copyright to the
government, which would again give the government the right to release
the software as open source software.

If there is an existing contract, you *must* check the contract to
determine the specific situation; the text above merely describes common
cases. There are many alternative clauses in the FAR and DFARS, and
specific contracts can (and often do) have different specific agreements
on who has which rights to software developed under a government
contract. The FAR and DFARS specifically permit different agreements to
be struck, within certain boundaries, and other agencies have other
supplements.

If the intent of a contract is to develop software to be released as
open source software, it is best to expressly include release as OSS as
part of the contract. This makes the expectations clear to all parties,
which may be especially important as personnel change.

Other laws must still be obeyed. Classified information may not be
released to the public without special authorization to do so. The
release of the software may be restricted by the International Traffic
in Arms Regulation (ITAR) or Export Administration Regulation (EAR). The
release may also be limited by patent and trademark law.

(See also ["Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the
U.S. Government" by Dr. David A. Wheeler, DoD Software Tech News,
February 2011](http://journal.thedacs.com/issue/56/180).)

### Q: Is there a standard marking for software where the government has unlimited rights?

The FAR and DFARS do not currently mandate any specific marking for
software where the government has unlimited rights. This can be a cause
of great confusion, because without any markings, a recipient is often
unaware that the government has unlimited rights to it. Yet if the
government does not know it has certain rights, it becomes difficult for
the government to exercise its rights. This is important for releasing
OSS, because the government can release software as OSS if it has
unlimited rights.

The following marking should be added to software when the government
has unlimited rights due to the use of the DFARS 252.227-7014 contract:

"The U.S. Government has Unlimited Rights in this computer software
pursuant to the clause at DFARS 252.227-7014. Any reproduction of this
computer software, or portions thereof, marked with this legend must
also reproduce these markings."

### Q: Does releasing software under an OSS license count as commercialization?

In most cases, yes. U.S. law governing federal procurement
[U.S. Code Title 41, Chapter 7, Section 403](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/41/usc_sec_41_00000403----000-.html) defines "commercial item"
as including "Any item, other than real property, that is of a type
customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities
for purposes other than governmental purposes (i.e., it has some
non-government use), and (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the
general public; or (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to
the general public ...". Thus, as long as the software has at least one
non-governmental use, software released (or offered for release) to the
public is a commercial item for procurement purposes, *even if* it was
originally developed using public funds.

This does not mean that organizations will automatically arise to help
develop/support it. Whether or not this will occur depends on factors
such as the number of potential users (more potential users makes this
more likely), the existence of competing OSS programs (which may
out-compete the newly released component), and how difficult it is to
install/use. Thus, components that have the potential to (eventually)
support many users are more likely to succeed. Similarly, delaying a
component's OSS release too long may doom it, if another OSS component
is released first. If the OSS is intended for use on Linux/Unix systems,
[follow standard source installation release
practices](http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/releasing-floss-software.html)
so that it is easier for users to install.


### Q: What license should the government or contractor choose/select when releasing open source software?

It depends on the goals for the project, however, here are some
guidelines:

-   **Copyright public domain where required by law.**  You *must*
    release it without any copyright protection (e.g., as "copyright
    public domain") if you release it at all and if it was developed by
    US government employee(s) as part of their official duties. 
    Otherwise, choose some existing OSS license, since all existing
    licenses add some legal protections from lawsuits. (The "MIT
    license" is similar to public domain release, but with some legal
    protection from lawsuits.)
-   **Release modifications under same license.**  If it is a
    modification of an existing project, or a plug-in to it, release it
    under the project's original license (and possibly other licenses).
    This way, the software can be incorporated in the existing project,
    saving time and money in support.
-   **Consider anticipated uses.**  If it must work with other
    components, or is anticipated to work with other components, ensure
    that the license will permit those anticipated uses. In particular,
    will it be directly linked with proprietary or classified code?
-   **Make sure it's really OSS.**  Choose a license that has passed
    legal reviews and is clearly accepted as an OSS license. Choose a
    license that is recognized as an [Open Source Software license by
    the Open Source Initiative
    (OSI)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category), a [Free
    Software license by the Free Software Foundation
    (FSF)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses),
    *and* is acceptable to widely-used Linux distributions (such as
    being a ["good" license for
    Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Software_License_List))**.**
-   **Use a widely-used existing license.**  Choose a widely-used
    existing license; do *not* create a new license. This eliminates
    future incompatibility and encourages future contributions by
    others. [Bruce Perens noted back in
    1999](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html),
    "Do not write a new license if it is possible to use (a common
    existing license)... The propagation of many different and
    incompatible licenses works to the detriment of Open Source software
    because fragments of one program cannot be used in another program
    with an incompatible license." [Many view OSS license proliferation
    as a
    problem](http://news.cnet.com/Open-source-board-eyes-fewer-licenses/2100-7344_3-5578799.html);
    [Serdar Yegulalp's 2008 "Open Source Licensing Implosion"
    (InformationWeek)](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/08/the_open_source_2.html)
    noted that not only are there too many OSS licenses, but that the
    "consequences for blithely creating new ones are finally becoming
    concrete... the vast majority of open source products out there use
    a small handful of licenses... Now that open source is becoming
    (gasp) a mainstream phenomenon, using one of the less-common
    licenses or coming up with one of your own works against you more
    often than not". As an aid, the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)
    maintains a list of "Licenses that are popular and widely used or
    with strong
    communities"](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category). Another
    useful source is the list of [licenses accepted by the Google code
    hosting
    service](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/25/googlecode_bans_mpl/).
    See the licenses listed in the FAQ question "What are the major
    types of open source software licenses?".
-   **Choose a GPL-compatible license.** The GNU General Public License
    (GPL) is the most common OSS license; while you do not need to use
    the GPL, it is often unwise to choose a license incompatible with
    the majority of OSS. Thus, avoid releasing software under only the
    original ("4-clause") BSD license (which has been replaced by the
    "new" or "revised" 3-clause licence), the "Academic Free License"
    (AFL), the now-abandoned "Common Public License" 1.0 (CPL), the
    "Open Software License" (OSL), or the "Mozilla Public License
    version 1.1" (MPL 1.1).
-   **Choose a license that best meets your goals.** Choosing between
    the various options - particularly between permissive, weakly
    protective, and strongly protective options - is perhaps the most
    difficult, because this selection depends on your goals, and there
    are many opinions on which licenses are most appropriate for
    different circumstances. A "permissive" license permits arbitrary
    use of the program, including making proprietary versions of it. A
    "protective" license "protects" the software from becoming
    proprietary, and instead enforces a "share and share alike" approach
    between parties. A "weakly-protective" license is a compromise
    between the two, preventing the covered library from becoming
    proprietary yet permitting it to be embedded in larger proprietary
    works. If the goal is maximize the use of a technology or standard
    in a variety of different applications/implementations, including
    proprietary ones, permissive licenses may be especially useful. 
    However, if the goal is to encourage longevity and cost savings
    through a commonly-maintained library or application, protective
    licenses may have some advantages, because they encourage developers
    to contribute their improvements back into a single common
    project. In many cases, weakly protective licenses are used for
    common libraries, while strongly protective licenses are used for
    applications. Common licenses for each type are:
    -   Permissive: MIT, BSD-new, Apache 2.0
    -   Weakly protective: LGPL (version 2 or 3)
    -   Strongly protective: GPL (version 2 or 3)

Licenses that meet all the criteria above include the [MIT
license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), [revised
BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), the
[Apache 2.0 license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php)
(though Apache 2.0 is only compatible with GPL version 3 not GPL version
2), the [GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php) versions
2.1 or 3, and the [GNU General Public License
(GPL)](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php) versions 2 or
3.

In some cases, it may be wise to release software under multiple
licenses (e.g., "LGPL version 2.1 and version 3", "GPL version 2 and
3"), so that users can then pick which license they will use. This can
increase the number of potential users.

### Q: How should I create an open source software project?

First, get approval to publicly release the software.  One way to deal
with potential export control issues is to make this request in the same
way as approving public release of other data/documentation.

If it is an improvement to an existing project, release it to the main
OSS project, in whatever format they prefer changes. Many prefer
"unified diff patches", generated by "diff -u" or similar commands. Most
projects prefer to receive a set of smaller changes, so that they can
review each change for correctness.

If it is a new project, be sure to remove "barriers to entry" for others
to contribute to the project:

-   Use a common OSS license well-known to be OSS (GPL, LGPL, MIT/X,
    BSD-new, Apache 2.0) – don’t write your own license
-   Establish project website. Typically this will include source code
    version management system, a mailing list, and an issue tracker.
-   Document the project's purpose, scope, and major decisions - users
    must be able to quickly determine if this project might meet their
    needs.
-   Use typical OSS infrastructure, tools, etc. Requiring the use of
    very unusual development tools may impede development, unless those
    tools provide a noticeable advantage.
-   Maximize portability, and avoid requiring proprietary
    languages/libraries unnecessarily. The more potential users, the
    more potential developers.
-   The released version *Must run*. Small-but-running is better than
    big-and-not.
-   Establish vetting process(es) before government will use updated
    versions (testing, etc.)
-   Determine if there will be a government-paid lead.

### Q: In what form should I release open source software?

OSS should be released using conventional formats that make it easy to
install (for end-users) and easy to update (for potential
co-developers). These formats may, but need not, be the same.

If you are releasing OSS source code for Unix-like systems (including
Linux and MacOS), you should follow the usual conventions for doing so
as described below:

-   [Releasing Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) for Source
    Installation](http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/releasing-floss-software.html)
-   [GNU Coding Standards, especially on the release
    process](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Managing-Releases.html)
-   [Software Release Practice
    HOWTO](http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/)

### Q: Where can I release open source software that are new projects to the public?

You may use existing industry OSS project hosting services such as
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/),
[Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org/), [Tigris](http://www.tigris.org/),
[Google code](http://code.google.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/),
[Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/), [Apache Software
Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) or [Microsoft
CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/). [Wikipedia's "Comparison of OSS
hosting facilities"
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities)
may be helpful in identifying existing hosting facilities, as well as
some of their pros and cons. Each hosting service tends to be focused on
particular kinds of projects, so prefer a hosting service that
well-matches the project. Using industry OSS project hosting services
makes it easier to collaborate with other parties outside the U.S. DoD
or U.S. government. The [Government Services Administration (GSA) has an
agreement with
SourceForge](https://apps.gov/cloud/advantage/cloud/sa_details.do?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&clid=160&catId=66).

DISA's [Forge.mil](https://www.forge.mil/) is "a family of services
provided to support the DoD's technology development community. The
system currently enables the collaborative development and use of open
source and DoD community source software. These initial software
development capabilities are growing to support the full system
life-cycle and enable continuous collaboration among all stakeholders
including developers, testers, certifiers, operators, and users." It
uses a variant of the software used by SourceForge.

If the project is likely to become large, or must perform filtering for
public release, it may be better to establish its own website. Note that
many of the largest commercially-supported OSS projects have their own
sites.

### Q: Can the government or contractor use trademarks, service marks, and/or certification marks with OSS projects?

Yes, both the government and contractors may obtain and use trademarks,
service marks, and/or certification marks for software, including OSS.
For example, trademarks and certification marks can be used to
differentiate one version of OSS from others, e.g., to designate certain
releases as an "official" version. Depending on your goals, a trademark,
service mark, or certification mark may be exactly what you need.

According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO):

-   A trademark is "a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination
    thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods
    of one party from those of others."
-   A service mark is "a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a
    combination thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of
    a service rather than goods. The term 'trademark' is often used to
    refer to both trademarks and service marks.
-   A certification mark is "any word, phrase, symbol or design, or a
    combination thereof owned by one party who certifies the goods and
    services of others when they meet certain standards. The owner of
    the mark exercises control over the use of the mark; however,
    because the sole purpose of a certification mark is to indicate that
    certain standards have been met, use of the mark is by others."

For more about trademarks, see the [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
(PTO) page "Trademark
basics"](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/index.jsp). Note:

-   You don't have to register a trademark to have a trademark. If you
    claim rights to use a mark, "you may simply use the 'TM' (trademark)
    or 'SM' (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim
    of ownership of the mark". However, there are advantages to
    registering a trademark, especially for enforcement. There is a fee
    for registering a trademark. You may only claim that a trademark is
    registered if it is actually registered. For more information, see
    the [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) page "Should I register
    my mark?"](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/register.jsp)
-   It can sometimes be a challenge to find a good name. Using a made-up
    word that has no Google hits is often a good start, but again, see
    the PTO site for more information.
-   You *do* have to police the trademark's use, or you could lose it.

OSS-like development approaches within the government
-----------------------------------------------------

### Q: What are "Open Government Off-the-Shelf" (OGOTS) or "Government OSS" (GOSS)?

Software that is developed collaboratively by multiple organizations
within the government and its contractors for government use, and
*not* released to the public, is sometimes called "Open Government
Off-the-Shelf" (OGOTS) or "Government OSS" (GOSS). Often there is a
single integrating organization, while other organizations inside the
government submit proposed changes to the integrator. In some cases
access is limited to portions of the government instead of the entire
government.

Reasons for taking this approach vary. In some cases, there are
nationally strategic reasons the software should not be released to the
public (e.g., it is classified). In some other cases, the government
lacks the rights to release the software to the public, e.g., the
government may only have "Government Purpose Rights" (GPR).

OGOTS/GOSS software is often not OSS; software is only OSS if it meets
the definition of OSS. For example, software that can only be used for
government purposes is not OSS, since it cannot be used for any purpose.
However, sometimes OGOTS/GOSS software is later released as OSS. This
might occur, for example, if the government originally only had
Government Purpose Rights (GPR), but later the government received
unlimited rights and released the software as OSS.

Some people like the term GOSS, because it indicates an intent to do
OSS-like collaborative development, but within the government instead.
Others do not like the term GOSS, because GOSS is not actually OSS, and
they believe the term can be misleading. In either case, it is important
to understand that GOSS is typically *not* OSS, though GOSS may be a
stepping stone towards later OSS release. Since both terms are in use,
the rest of this document will use the term OGOTS/GOSS.

### Q: Does the U.S. government sometimes use OSS-like development processes internally?

Yes. Examples of OGOTS/GOSS software include:

-   Ozone Widget Framework (OWF) - a presentation-tier integration
    framework enabling widgets (light-weight web applications) to
    interact within a user's browser, and its companion project
-   Ozone Marketplace (OMP) - provides an AppStore type of functionality
    in which capabilities (widgets, as well as others) can be exposed in
    a market for developers and end-users to discover.
-   Older versions of Falconview (though it is now OSS).

Some systems have been set up within the government to store or
collaboratively develop government-internal software. These include:

-   [Forge.mil](http://www.forge.mil); see especially
    [software.forge.mil](http://software.forge.mil). Note that although
    they use the Open Source model, forge.mil is NOT open source.
    Downloading requires acceptance of their license that bans use,
    modification, reproduction, release, performance, or display for
    commercial or non-governmental purposes.

### What is Open Technology Development (OTD)? What is its relationship to OSS?

OTD is an approach to software/system development in which developers
(in multiple organizations) collaboratively develop and maintain
software or a system in a decentralized fashion. OTD depends on open
standards and interfaces, open source software and designs,
collaborative and distributed online tools, and technological agility.

OTD includes *both* OSS and OGOTS/GOSS. An OTD project *might* be OSS,
but it also might not be (it might be OGOTS/GOSS instead). Even if an
OTD project is not OSS itself, an OTD project will typically use,
improve, or create OSS components.

### Are there guidance documents on OGOTS/GOSS?

Yes:

-   [Open Technology Development Lessons
    Learned](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/OTD-lessons-learned-military-signed.pdf)
    includes discussions that apply to OGOTS/GOSS and OSS with
    government involvement.
-   [Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Government
    Open-Source Software (GOSS) “Handbook for
    Govies”](http://mil-oss.org/resources/goss-govies_v1.7_29jun2011_released.pdf)
    includes guidance specific to OGOTS/GOSS.

### Q: Where do OSS developers congregate and what conferences should I go to?

The DoD does not endorse any specific event or conference. That said,
there are conferences and organizations specifically focused on OSS in
the government or military context, at which DoD personnel have
presented information on DoD policy and OSS. For example:

-   The [Military Open Source Software
    (Mil-OSS)](http://www.mil-oss.org/) was established to "connect and
    empower an active community of civilian and military open source
    software and hardware developers across the U.S.". It has hosted at
    least three conferences: August 2009 (Atlanta, GA), August 2010
    (Washington, DC), and August/September 2011 (Atlanta, GA).
-   The Government Open Source Conference ([GOSCON](http://goscon.org/))
    has been held on November 2009 and August 2011 in Washington, DC.
